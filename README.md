# K-Means Clustering 

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm applied to a dataset of mall customer credit card spending. K-Means is a popular clustering technique used to partition data into distinct groups based on feature similarity.

## Overview

In this project, we use the K-Means algorithm to cluster mall customers based on their credit card spending data and annual income and age. This can help in identifying distinct customer segments for targeted marketing strategies.

## Features

- **K-Means Clustering:** Implementing the K-Means algorithm using sklearn.
- **Visualization:** Visualizing clusters and cluster centers in 2D ( Annual Income vs Spending Score ) space and 3D space (Annual Income vs Spending Score vs Age ).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DawnJo123/KMeans-Clustering.git
```

2. Place Your dataset in the Dataset folder:
Ensure your dataset (SalaryData.csv) is placed in the Dataset folder within the repository.

3. Run the code to view the visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains information on mall customers' credit card spending behavior. It includes features such as annual income and spending score.
